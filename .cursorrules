# Bilfen Blog - Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a monorepo containing a full-stack blog application with the following structure:
- **backend/**: Node.js API (Express + TypeScript)
- **web/**: Nuxt 2 web application (Nuxt 2 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS)
- **mobile/**: React Native app (Expo + TypeScript) - **DO NOT WORK ON THIS UNLESS EXPLICITLY REQUESTED**

## Important Rules

### Mobile Development
- **DO NOT implement, modify, or work on the mobile app unless the user explicitly says "now we are going to implement mobile" or similar direct instruction**
- Mobile is currently out of scope for development
- Only backend and web app should be worked on by default

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, Node.js
- **Web**: Nuxt 2 (NOT Nuxt 3), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Use npm workspaces for dependency management
- Follow TypeScript best practices with strict mode

### Code Quality
- Use Prettier for code formatting (configured at root)
- Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
- Follow existing code patterns and structure

### Development Workflow
- Always work from the monorepo root when using workspace commands
- Backend runs on port 4000 by default
- Web app runs on port 3000 by default
- Use `npm run dev:backend` and `npm run dev:web` to start apps

## Current Status
- All three apps are scaffolded with placeholder functionality
- Backend has stub endpoints for articles
- Web app has placeholder pages and API client
- No database integration yet
- Full CRUD operations not yet implemented
